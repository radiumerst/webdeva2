            <h2>Visit Japan Web</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.vjw.digital.go.jp/" target="_blank">Visit Japan Web</a> is the Japanese pre-immigration page. You will need to pre-register your immigration and customs declaration on the website for a smoother process into Japan.</p>

            <h2>Transportation IC Card</h2>
            <p>Currently, at least in Tokyo, transportation IC cards are really hard to come by. Suica can only be purchased in the main ticket office at Tokyo Station.</p>
            <p>If you have an Apple device, lucky for you! You can install a virtual Suica card into your Apple wallet and top-up using your credit/debit card!</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Money</h2>
            <p>Despite being a modern society, many shops in Japan, especially small local ones accept cash only.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if you plan to get a physical Transportation IC Card, you can only recharge using cash.</p>
